## westbrook

This project is for generating RSS feeds.

It is used by creating a westbrook:feed object, adding westbrook:item
objects to the feed, then using westbrook:generate or
westbrook:generate-to to write the XML feed to a string or file.

I use it to generate feeds for Quicklisp build failure reports.
